# Installation

To play on a CoD4x 1.8+ enabled server, each player is required to use the CoD4x client. The client can be installed in various ways. Typically, you just connect to any CoD4x 1.8+ server and you will be asked to install the client. This will happen

## Manual Installation

If the automated installer is not working for you, the client can still be installed manually. We provide the files to patch your Call of Duty 4 MW client to 1.8 on our website. The files can be [downloaded here](https://cod4x.me/downloads/cod4x_client.zip). After downloading and unpacking the files, make sure your folder structure looks as outlined below.

```
Call of Duty 4 MW
├── cod4x_client <<-- your unpacked folder here
    ├── cod4x_017.dll
    ├── crashrpt1403.dll
    ├── install.cmd   
    ├── uninstall.cmd
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── iw3mp.exe                     
├── miles32.dll
├── mss32.dll
├── <and some more other files and folders>
```

At this point just double-click `install.cmd` to install the CoD4x client files. Finally run your game as usual. On the main screen you will now notice that the games version changed from 1.7 to
