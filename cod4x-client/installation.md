# Installation

To play on a CoD4x 1.8+ enabled server, each player is required to use the CoD4x client. The client can be installed in various ways. Typically, you just connect to any CoD4x 1.8+ server and you will be asked to install the client. Choose to just temporarily run the client, or to install the client to your system, and follow the instructions.

## Installing Updates

Updates to the CoD4x Client are provided via an auto-update system. When starting the client check out the main menu, if you see a button saying "Auto update", press it and the update will be installed to your computer.

## Manual Client Installation

If the automated installer is not working for you, the client can still be installed manually. We provide the files to patch your Call of Duty 4 MW client to 1.8 on our website. The files can be [downloaded here](https://cod4x.me/downloads/cod4x_client.zip). After downloading and unpacking the files, make sure your folder structure looks as outlined below.

```
Call of Duty 4 MW
├── cod4x_client <<-- your unpacked folder here
    ├── cod4x_017.dll
    ├── crashrpt1403.dll
    ├── install.cmd   
    ├── uninstall.cmd
    ├── <and some more other files>
├── iw3mp.exe                     
├── miles32.dll
├── mss32.dll
├── <and some more other files and folders>
```

At this point just double-click `install.cmd` to install the CoD4x client files. Finally run your game as usual. On the main menu you will now notice that the games version changed from 1.7 to 1.8.

## CoD4x on Mac and Linux

A native version of CoD4x is not available for Mac computers. We are sorry for not providing a Mac version of CoD4x, but for the very small audience and our limited ressources it is not feasible to support other operating systems natively.

If you still want to run CoD4x on a Mac consider using [Bootcamp](https://support.apple.com/de-at/boot-camp).
